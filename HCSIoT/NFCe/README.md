## Abstract
The application of interactive technology seems to be more and more inseparable from smartphones, so many times we have to take
out mobile phones to interact, such as NFC-based interaction. In this project, we proposed a body-centric interaction design space, and a design of wearable NFC relays that enable body-centric interactions for a commodity near-field communication (NFC) device. The passive extenders worn on the body can extend the operating range of the NFC reader/writer of a smartphone to the reach of the wearer’s hand, arm, or foot. These NFC devices can capture the near-field interactions between the human body and NFC-tagged objects. We explored the design space and elucidated the applications in human-computer interaction as well as IoT lifestyle. Our implementation demonstrated the proposed applications’ technical feasibility and aroused more ideas in the co-creation workshop to be generated. We also release an open-source library called OpenNFCSense, a system for detecting the movements of near-field communication (NFC) tags using a commodity, low-cost RC522 NFC reader. With a user-defined tag profile, the users can use its application programming interface (API) to obtain the NFC tagged objects’ motion speed, motion frequency, and motion type while recognizing these tagged objects.
