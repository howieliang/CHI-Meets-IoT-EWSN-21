## Welcome to CHI Meets IoT: Workshop on Computer-Human Interaction and Human-Based Applications Using IoT Solutions
In this workshop, we bring together researchers and practitioners from industrial design, computer science, and electrical engineering working on new challenges in industry and academia. The workshop will provide a platform for participants to review and discuss challenges and opportunities in the intersection of computer-human interaction and the internet of things, focusing on human-based applications using emerging connectivity and sensing technologies. We aim to jointly develop a design space and identify opportunities for future research.

\title{CHI Meets IoT: Workshop on Computer

## Goal of The Workshop
In this workshop, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with emerging IoT technologies in human-based applications. It will bring together an international and cross-disciplinary group of researchers from academia and industry to collaborate and explore the topic. We aim at building a community in which CHI and IoT researchers can exchange views and begin fruitful collaboration.

## Call for Participation
We invite position papers for the EWSN 2021 Workshop on Computer-Human Interaction Meets Internet of Things (CHI Meets IoT). This half-day workshop will offer a cross-disciplinary forum of discussion and knowledge exchange for researchers in the both fields. This workshop looking at the intersection of IoT and CHI, where IoT platforms focusing on human-based applications and CHI studies using IoT solutions to build interactive environments.  

Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 
- Emotion recognition and affective computing in IoT 
- Edge computing for IoT and Cognitive IoT
- Tools and platforms for prototyping Human-IoT experiences
- Battery-less, wireless, self-sustained sensors and platforms
- Embedded AI for CHI-IoT applications  
- Sensing and monitoring applications with LP-WAN technologies  
- Human-IoT systems communication
- Visible light systems for sensing and communication
- Novel user interface technology for Human-IoT interaction
- Remote sensing solutions based on LiDAR, mmWave, or acoustic sensors  
- Human Factors in Human-IoT systems  
- 5G and Beyond-5G studies for indoor and city scenarios 

Researchers from both Computer-Human Interaction and IoT Systems are invited to submit a position paper. This position paper should address one or more of the workshop’s topic of interests or suggest another (we encourage vision and provocation). All submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers. Paper accompanying demos are encouraged, and will be allocated time in the workshop agenda. Participants will be selected on the basis of the quality of their position paper and on the basis of background and perspective.  

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and for one day of the conference itself. Participants will be invited to present a position statement at the workshop and will actively engage in a discourse on the meaningful design space for researching computer-human interaction and human-based applications in Internet of Things. \\

**Important Dates**
- Abstract deadlines for position papers: December 23th, 2020
- Submission deadline for position papers: January 6th, 2020. 
- Notification of acceptance: January 13th, 2021.
