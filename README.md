## Welcome to *CHIIoT 2*: 2nd Workshop on Computer Human Interaction in IoT Applications

The *CHIIoT* workshop series bring together researchers and practitioners from HCI design, computer science, and electrical engineering working on new challenges in industry and academia. The workshop will provide a platform for participants to review and discuss challenges and opportunities in the intersection of computer-human interaction and the internet of things, focusing on human-centered applications using emerging connectivity and sensing technologies. We aim to jointly develop a design space and identify opportunities for future research. 

The second workshop (__CHIIoT 2__) will be co-located with **[EICS 2021](https://eics.acm.org/eics2021/)**: The 13th ACM SIGCHI Engineering Interactive Computing Systems (EICS) conference.

## Position Paper Submission Deadline: May 12, 2021 (AoE) (Abstract Deadline: May 5, 2021 (AOE))
We invite 2-6 pages position paper submissions using the ACM [Two-column SIGCHI Master template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) The submission doesnot have to be anonymized. This position paper should address one or more of the workshop’s topics of interest or suggest another (we encourage visionary and provocative ideas). All submissions will be reviewed by the technical program committee. Paper accompanying demos are encouraged, and will be allocated time in the workshop agenda. Participants will be selected on the basis of the quality of their position paper and on the basis of background and perspective. Multimedia files should be attached as an link in the footnote.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and for one day of the conference itself. Participants will be invited to present a position statement at the workshop and will actively engage in a discourse on the meaningful design space for researching computer-human interaction and human-centered applications in Internet of Things. The presenting author will receive a discount for the registration.

All materials must be submitted electronically to 
**[EasyChair System](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chiiot2)** by the deadline.

### FAQ 1: Could we resubmit or feature the work that has been or will be submitted to other venues?##
**Yes.** CHIIoT workshops are forums for cross-displinary discussion, so Prior/In-Press publications are *allowed and encouraged* to be included in your position papers. Later you can *opt-out* of the public release on our website so it will not introduce any trouble to your under-reviewing, accepted, or future submissions. Nonetheless, please note that your position papers will be shared among all the registered workshop participants. All Camera-Ready papers will be made available for the workshop attendee through a password-protected download link.

### FAQ 2: Could we publish archival papers in CHIIoT? ##
**Yes.** CHIIoT 2 will published the our own proceedings with [CEUR-WS](http://ceur-ws.org/) together with papers accepted in CHIIoT 1, so that your position paper will be indexed in Scopus, Google Scholar, and likely DBLP [Ref](http://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html). Also, the references will count into the citation statistics of these platforms, gaining your research visibility to the researchers cited by you. Your paper will be open-access and hosted by the CEUR-WS.org under the Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). We will ask for your permission release for this option.  

## Attending CHIIoT 2
